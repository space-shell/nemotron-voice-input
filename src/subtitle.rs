//! Native backend for `LiveSubtitleService` (real-time captions for device audio).
//!
//! Audio arrives via `pushAudio` in small blocks (~64 ms). We build up a
//! *segment* of speech, send the whole segment to a worker thread for
//! transcription roughly once per tick, and display the result as a *partial*
//! (replaceable) caption. When trailing silence is detected — or the segment
//! hits a hard cap — the segment is *finalized*: transcribed once more and
//! committed, then the buffer starts fresh.
//!
//! Three things keep latency low and bounded:
//! - Partial jobs are only submitted while the worker is idle (latest-wins),
//!   so a slow device can never build up a queue and drift behind real time.
//! - Final jobs are always queued (FIFO), so committed text is never lost.
//! - When finals queue up faster than they are processed, the worker folds
//!   them into one batched run: fixed-window models (Whisper) cost nearly
//!   the same per run regardless of audio length, so batching is what lets
//!   a slow device catch up instead of dropping text.
